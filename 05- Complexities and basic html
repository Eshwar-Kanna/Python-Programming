Space Complexity :  The space used by the process in the ram for the execution of particular code 
Time Complexity  :  The Time Taken by the CPU to run the process and produce Output 

Higher the Space Complexity higher the Time complexity

STATIC  : A program that provide fixed output

usage format of  Fieldstorage in code
        import cgi
         y = Fieldstorage()
         o = y.getvalue(x)
         print(o)
         
         
   import subprocess
   subprocess.getoutput()  used to convert string to command     similar to os.system    but  os.syatem cannot return the output 
   to use in other functions for such usecase we use subprocess
