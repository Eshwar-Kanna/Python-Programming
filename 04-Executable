the slicing syntax of an  Array
      variablename[from : to : jump , index of column ]

Bydefault the slicing operator perform jump as 1  

reversing the data using the slicing can be done by   :   varname[-1 : : -1]

we use   in  operator   to find some value in the data
    ex  :   data = [ "kanna" , "tom" , "clarie" , "bob"]
    
    kanna    in    data     -  it gives  output as true
    
    we can use pre-defined functions of python to a variable such as  
          varname.upper()   , varname.lower() , varname.capitalize()  
          
    we can use   or , and operator in the condition of loops  . or used for either conditions , and used  to run only if both are true
    
    
    Technologies like  Cloud , DevOps and many other work on API 
    
    So the python can be able to run on API to use python as language in such technologies 
    
    
   for such we setup RHEL  in Virtual Box 
   
   
   instead notepad we use gedit in rhel
   
   Running in  API is such as running the file in other OS without logging in to it 
   
    for such case we set or configure CGI ( Common Gatewat Interface ) that run the process on behalf us instead allowing us to login 
    
                                          CONFIGURING CGI     
    
    
      yum install  httpd  -y 
      
      systemctl start httpd 
      
      The httpd server  run the file that present in the folder /var/www/html
      
      to run the file as a command   that means to make a file executable    we should create the file in a folder /var/www/cgi-bin/
      
      for giving the permission of execute to a file use command 
      
          chmod +x  file.py
          
          
      To specify the type of code in the file so as to use that particular interpreter we define   the code by shebang / hashbang  in code 
      
      
      ex :  kanna.py
      
      #!/usr/bin/python3
      print("content-type:text/html")
      print()
      
          print("this is run from a  file")
          
          
    kanna.py     gives the output     where it run as a command like date , cal
    
    to access the resourses of OS  we imported OS and used system function it  for similar operation we can use  subprocess module
    
          import subprocess 
          subprocess.getoutput("")
          
          
    API   -  Application Program Interface
    
   URL    - Uniform Resource Location
