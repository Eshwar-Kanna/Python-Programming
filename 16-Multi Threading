Kernel is the resource of OS that connects software and Hardware and this will provide the PID

ps -aux    :  to list all processes running in OS

PID works as Directory  for particular process 

terminating a process means killing the PID

cd /proc/    - this is the folder where we get all the PID's

When we run the code each statement of code is sent to the process and process send single process to the CPU  thus cpu 
  run the processes  one after another  here each process is known as single Thread


run gedit status  from any PID   their it provide the threading type

To run multiple threads in parallel  we import threading

we can able to open multiple tabs in the browser only because of Multi threading



     
      
   1.   def a() :
        while True :
          print("aaa")
                                        here the output will be only  a  since this process will not end and b runs only after a
      def b():
        while True :
          print("bbbb")
          
          
          
  2.   import threading
       
       
      def a() :
        while True :
          print("aaa")
                                        here the output will be   a and b  in parallel  
      def b():
        while True :
          print("bbbb")
       x1 = threading.Thread(target = a)
       x2 = threading.Thread(target = b)
       
       x1.start()
       x2.start()
       
       here it will be three threads  1 is x1 , 2 is x2  and 3 is the complete code
