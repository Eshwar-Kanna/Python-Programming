 Automation tools like Ansible , Terraform , Data Science , Jenkins , Bigdata , Mobile UI  , Cloud Computing , IOT  and  Augmented Reality   . To integrate or make communication to one another we require a unique language where mostly used Python
 
 
 There  are many softwares and palatforms to use python or write python code but here we use  Anaconda jupyter
 
 to check the version of python pre installed in os   
                python  -v 
                
  print()  is used to display the output 
  
  exit() is used to  terminate the python shell
  
  though we are running python software on the os  we can operate the resources of OS using python modules or libraries
  
         OS  , pyttsx3 , subprocess 
         
        os.system("notepad")     -    it will open the notepad 
        pyttsx3.speak("welcome")  -   it access to speaker and provide voice output
        
        
        
  We can run the code offline and online  
  OFFLINE - writing script in file and run python3 <file>.py     
  ONLINE - open python shell and write command  (INTERPRETING)  Runs LINE BY LINE
  
  We have limited languages that can be used both online and offline  in which python is one 
  
  
  When an app is stored in HardDisk then it said to ba a Program 
  when the app launched and load on RAM said to be Process
