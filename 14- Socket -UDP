The protocol that is used for trasferring the data through network should be supported by both OS to transfer 

UDP send the data to client even if  the client server is offline which is not secure

Remote Execution (ssh , Telnet )  is the process in which the data sent remotely used for as command and execute

      ex :    using system function      -   os.system("date")
      
      
      but in the servers like Google  we have one server but millions of client . in that case   the data will be sent from 
        million  clients  to same server
        
     To receive the data in parallel , from the clients   we required Multi Threading which is known as parallelism
     
     
     sock_DGRAM  is used for UDP protocol
     
     
              code in server   
              
                    import socket 
                    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET , socket.sock_DGRAM)
                    ip = "192.168.0.12"
                    port = 1234
                    s.bind((ip,port))
                    while True :
                      x = s.recvfrom(10)
                      clientip = x[1][0]
                      data = x[0].decode()
                      print(clientip  + ":" + data)
                      
                      
                      
                      
                 code in client 
                 
                    import socket
                    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET , socket.sock.DGRAM)
                    data = b"firefox"
                    s.sendto(data , (192.168.0.12 , 1234))
