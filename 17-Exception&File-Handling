        ---------------------------       Exception or Error Handling     -------------------



try  ; except ; finally   are the keyword we use in exceptional Handling

we can also use try inside try   : nested

syntax to use the try is

          try :
            <write code >
          
          except <type of error> (SyntaxError) :
                print ("check the syntax")
                
          finally :
              print ("the code ended")
          
          
 finally will run all the time the code run
 
 types of error :   SyntaxError , ValueError , NameError
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ---------------------------------          File Handling     ---------------------------
 
 
 
 EOL  ( End Of Line )   
 
                  this is used to specify that  end character of the line
                        
                        in windows   we use      \r\n
                        in linux     we use       \n
                        
                        
  EOF  (End Of Line )
                         this is used to specify that the end character of File
                         
                         
                         
  cat  >>  index.html
  
            add data 
            
            press ctrl + d to save 
            
 f = open("index.txt"  , mode = 'r' )
 by giving the mode of r ie.read  we can only read the data but cannot update 
 
 f.read()  , f.tell() , f.close()           are the functions we can use 
 
 change the mode to  w from r   to give update or write acees to the file
 
 f = open("index.txt"  , mode = 'w' )
      f.write()   can also work here
      
      
 f.write()    keeps adding the data untill we close the function   . the updated data can be seen only after closing the function 
 
 f.seek()  is the function used to point the curser  at desired position
 
 f.seek(5,0)  : this place the curser at 5th position starting from 0th position
 
 to give read and write access to the file we use mode  as     r+
 
 
 but when we enable the mode as r+ for non exixring file or new file this command fail   but to provide read and write access to the 
          file by creating it  if not exist   we use  mode    w+
