for loop is used to run or operate one after  another  till end
  
          ex :
                x = [1,2,3,,4,5,6,7]
                for i in x :
                    print(i)
                    
            ex:
            
                y = []
                for j in x :
                j = i*i
                y.append(j)
                
                
                
       Readability  :   using inline approach  
            m = [i*i  for i  in  x ]
            n = [i*i  for i in x  if i>0 ]
            p = [i*i  if i>0  else 0  for i  in x ]
            
            
      Function   and Module
      
          def  kanna() :
              print("hiii")
              print("hello")
              
              
        to call this function use     kanna()
        
     def sum(a,b)
          x = a                                             here  a,b are parameters    and we can only use two numbers as input
          y = b
          m = x+y
          print(m)
          
          
     def sum(*i)
     
            m = 0
            for j in i :
              m = m + j 
              print(m)
          
          
          but to provide outpur when we call function   use return m  instead   print(m)
          
          
          we can assign the function to a variable   
                        x = sum
