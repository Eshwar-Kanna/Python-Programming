In Other Languages we should declare the Data Type But in Python It doesnot needed to declare the python default know according to syntax of the data written

to know the type of data    :   type(variable_name)

=>  we use   ' '  or " "  for String  data type

=>  Either True  or False is said to be Boolean

=>  []  : used for storing List of data

=>  ()  : used for tuple  

=>  In python we retrive  , Load , Read , data even without using the print function BCZ of  >>>  known as REPL  
    R - Read   ,  E - Evaluate ,  P - Print , L - Load
    
 But while performing python  offline  we must use print function
 
=>  we use list to store multiple data like  : data = [ "eric" , "tom" , 12453 , "good"]
    
    
      we can retrieve particular  data according to index  number in a  list  like   eric = data[0] , good = data[-1]
      
      we can perform slicing operator on the list  :   data[0:2] gives  ["eric"  , "tom"]  
      
        syntax for slicing list 
                  variable_name [ from : to ]   
                  
                  Note : the data given only till the index number mentioned not including the  value of that index number 

=> the slicing operator run the .__getitem__() function behind   to produce sliced output

=> but to perform slicing in column wise the list type doesnot support for such case we use Array kind of data

=>  to convert the list to array we use  :  numpy.array(variable)

=>  python bydefault provide error for some commands when we run from other path in which that command doesnot exist
