Every function is a reference in which it store all its statements



  def a() :
    while True :
      print("aaaaa")
      
      
   def b() :
      while True :
        print("bbbbbb")
        
 when we call  both functions  
 
 a()
 b()
 
 function b runs only after the a run and produce output
 
 
 Module is the program file which contains code and while using the module we should provide its namespace 
      ex :  while using read property of pandas we write    pandas.read()  where the namespace pandas is used before the read
      
 
 
 when we create a module it aquire many properties such as   .__name__    ,  .__main__
 
 
 when we create a custom module  it should be copied in     /usr/lib64/python3.6
 
    so this module can be run from any path
